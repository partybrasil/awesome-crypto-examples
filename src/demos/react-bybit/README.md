# React Demo with Bybit API

Simple demo made by [@princecoder000](https://github.com/princecoder000), showing how to use the Bybit API in a react app, using the Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript SDK "bybit-api" from npm.

## Usage

- `cd` into this folder
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run start` to run the dev server
- `npm run build` to build a deployable bundle, in the `build` folder

## Localhost

Note: due to CORS you cannot test with localhost. Either edit your hosts file to make a fake domain, pointed to 127.0.0.1 or deploy using a tool such as vercel.
